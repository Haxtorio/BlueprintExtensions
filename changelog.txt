Version: 0.2.3
Date: 14. 16. 2018
  Bugfixes:
    - Changed the default wireswap keybind to CTRL + ALT + W instead of SHIFT + W, as the latter would frequently
      interfere with movement.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.2.2
Date: 14. 10. 2018
  Additions:
    - You can now swap wire colors of a blueprint with SHIFT + W
    - You can now rotate a blueprint with CONTROL + ALT + R.  Unlike normal rotation, this modifies the actual
      blueprint and can be useful if you want to have all the blueprints in a book rotated the same direction.
  Changes:
    - When updating a blueprint, the blueprint is now cleared from the cursor (if there's room) while configuring it.
      This allows you to change blueprint icons without them all becoming icons of blueprints.
      When you finish configuring the blueprint, the blueprint will be moved back to the cursor.

      This more closely reflects vanilla blueprint behavior.

Version: 0.2.1
Date: 24. 04. 2018
  Bugfixes:
    - Actually flip splitter priorities upon mirroring like we said we would.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.2.0
Date: 23. 04. 2018
  Additions:
    - Added and reworked the blueprint flipping and turning functionality in the Blueprint Flipper and Turner mod,
      including a fix to priority splitters.
        * This functionality is disabled if Blueprint Flipper and Turner is enabled to avoid possible conflicts.
        * The GUI buttons for flipping blueprints can be disabled in mod settings.  Note this has no effect if
          Blueprint Flipper and Turner is disabled.
  Changes:
    - Internal reworking of code to be better organized.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.1.1
Date: 17. 12. 2017
  Bugfixes:
    - Fixed crash when blueprint-updating an empty area.
  Changes:
    - Blueprints can now be "versioned": Updating a blueprint with a label like "Train Station v.1" will make the
      updated blueprint default to "Train Station v.2".  By default, normal drag will update a version number if one is
      present, shift-drag will append "v.2" if no version number is present.  These options can be changed in mod
      settings.

Version: 0.1.0

  Changes:
    - First release.
